This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository is for the **Akuapem Paramount King Council Website** - an official website for the traditional council of the Akuapem kingdom in Ghana. The site serves as an interface between the council leadership and the community.

## Project Status

This project is in the **planning phase**. The sitemap document (`AKUAPEM_PARAMOUNT_KING_COUNCIL WEBSITE_SITEMAP v1.md`) outlines the requirements.

## Phase 1 Core Features (Launch Target: March 2026)

- **Home**: Hero section, announcements, events, subscription CTA
- **About**: Council history, Paramount King biography, organizational structure, 17 divisional chiefs
- **Towns & Communities**: Directory of 17 principal towns with individual pages
- **Community Updates**: Obituaries, wedding announcements, official council announcements (all with submission forms and approval workflows)
- **Notifications**: Email subscription system with category filtering (obituaries, weddings, council business)
- **Contact**: Form, palace location, social media

## Key Technical Considerations

- Content submission forms with approval workflows for obituaries and wedding announcements
- Image upload handling with specifications (max size, file types)
- Searchable archives filtered by town and date
- Email subscription system with preference management
- Multi-role admin system: Super Admin, Content Managers, Town Representatives
- Password-protected sections for chiefs (Phase 2)

## Phase 2 Features (Post-Launch)
